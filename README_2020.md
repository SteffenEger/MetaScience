### Seminar structure

This year, there are two tracks:

  * **Regular track**: one student prepares 1-3 papers on one topic. Requirements:
       - offline video presentation (~20min) on the papers; due around late June
       - online group discussion (~10-20min); due around mid July
       - term paper (4-6 papers); due around mid September
  * **Project track**: 2-4 students jointly work on a project, proposed by us
       - each student in the team reads 1-3 papers (relating to the project's topic), to understand the background
       - the team works on a solution to the problem (this typically involves coding)
       - The team writes a paper (8-10 pages) on their project; due mid-late July
       - We will offer 2-3 discussions with each group on the implementation and the write-up during the semester

We will offer up to 5 slots for the regular track and up to 5 slots for the project track. For the project track, students are allowed to self-select into teams.
